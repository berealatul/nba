I want to build a project for which i currently require:
    1. login functionality

I need it in following format which are standard
    technologies i will be using
        Mysql for database
        PHP for backend
        API for communication between frontend and backend
        Naming must be standard and follow best practices
        Restful API design principles and solid principles must be followed
        JWT for authentication
        
        for now database will contain only user related information
        user table will have following fields
            employee_id // numberic, primary key
            username
            email
            password (hashed)
            department_id
            role (admin, dean, hod, faculty, staff)

        do not make any frontend for now only backend and api is required
        provide endpoints for
            user login
            user profile retrieval
            user profile update
            user logout

        ensure proper validation and error handling for all endpoints
        include comments in code for better understanding

        git repo will contain
            react frontend build folder
            api/
                config/ (database connection and configuration files)
                controllers/ (handle the logic for each endpoint)
                models/ (database interaction and user model)
                routes/ (define API endpoints)
                middleware/ (authentication and validation middleware)
        
        make it as per xampp/htdocs/nba
        such a way that it can be directly placed in htdocs and run without any issues
        domain will be http://localhost/nba/ for homepage
        api endpoints will be like http://localhost/nba/api/login

        ensure CORS is handled properly for frontend-backend communication
